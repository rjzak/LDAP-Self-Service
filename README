INTRO

Welcome to my LDAP Self Service application.  This web application is a bit rough, but works.  It requires PHP 5+ with LDAP support.  It's only been tested with OpenLDAP and PHP 5 on Ubuntu Server 12.04.1.  I think it should work with any LDAP server, though it most certainly will NOT work with Microsoft Active Directory.  I created this application in my spare time to help me with the Sys Admin part of my job, so the main function is allowing users to change their password.  I then decided to take it a step further and make a proper web management application for LDAP, since none really exist, except Webmin, which is awesome but isn't for the regular user (I tried).  I wanted to make something that is lightweight, as in the L in LDAP. This project was also one of my first attempts at HTML 5.

REQUIREMENTS

Users with object classes: posixAccount, shadowAccount, inetOrgPerson
PHP 5
